```

## Behavior Tree Engine

The engine at `src/engine/` runs character AI in the browser via a standard behavior tree architecture:

- **Blackboard** — shared state (position, emotion, energy, pointer) accessible to all nodes
- **9 Node Types** — Sequence, Selector, Parallel, Inverter, Repeater, Cooldown, Condition, Action, Wait
- **RobotAdapter Interface** — abstract hardware layer; implement `init()`, `update()`, `sendCommand()` to connect any robot
- **CanvasAdapter** — built-in browser renderer with emotion glow, movement trails, and energy visualization

### Extending

```typescript
import { registerAction } from './engine'

// Add a custom action
registerAction('myAction', (bb, args, adapter) => {
  adapter.sendCommand({ type: 'move', payload: { x: bb.x, y: bb.y } })
  return 'success'
})
```

Implement `RobotAdapter` to connect physical hardware (ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.).

## Roadmap

> **North Star (immutable)**: _Give your robot a soul._ Make every physical
> toy / robot scriptable as a believable, character-driven agent.
>
> **Two non-negotiable axes** every release must satisfy:
>
> 1. **Debuggability** — every behavior, perception, decision and motor
>    command must be inspectable, replayable and visualizable.
> 2. **Real embodiment** — features land only with a real-hardware
>    demonstration. Sim-only work ships behind an `experimental/` flag.

### Where CyberAgent fits in the landscape

| Project | Personality / Character | Hardware abstraction | Hobby toys (<$100) | First-class debugger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CyberAgent** (this repo) | ✅ 55+ characters + BT | ✅ adapter contract | ✅ mBot / ESP32 / RoboMaster | ✅ time-travel + replay (planned) |
| HuggingFace LeRobot | ❌ policies, no character | ✅ Python `Robot` interface | ⚠️ research arms (SO-100, ALOHA) | ⚠️ training plots only |
| elizaOS | ✅ rich personas | ❌ chat / web only | ❌ no embodiment | ✅ web dashboard |
| NVIDIA Isaac Lab / GR00T | ❌ skill policies | ✅ Isaac Sim | ❌ humanoid-only | ⚠️ sim-side only |
| ROS 2 / Nav2 / MoveIt | ❌ | ✅ industrial | ❌ | ⚠️ rqt / RViz |
| Sony aibo / Anki Vector SDK | ✅ closed | ✅ closed | ⚠️ discontinued | ❌ |

The unique slot we own is **soul + cheap toys + radical debuggability**.

### Versioned task breakdown

Each version is a hard release with a `git tag`. The autonomous Cron picks
the **first unchecked, unblocked** item in the **earliest unreleased
version** and ships it end-to-end (code + test + debugger surface + docs +
HIL evidence when hardware is touched). It never invents scope outside this
list, and never skips a version.

#### v0.3 — Tracer foundation _(now → +1 month)_

Make the existing surface observable.

- [x] `src/engine/tracer.ts` — structured event stream
      (`tick.start`, `node.enter`, `node.exit`, `action.dispatch`,
      `adapter.tx`, `adapter.rx`, `bb.set`, `error`).
- [x] Wire tracer into `executor.ts`, `runner.ts`, `CanvasAdapter`,
      `WebSocketAdapter`, `MBotAdapter`,
      `RoboMasterAdapterV2`.
- [x] Persist last 1 000 events per session in IndexedDB.
- [x] CI: `tests/hil-emulator/` runs 1 character × 5 adapters for 60 s on
      mock hardware; fail on any `error` event.
- [x] Coverage gate ≥ 80 % on `src/engine/` and `src/adapters/`.
      (engine: 81.3%, adapters: 85.5%)
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents debug + embodiment invariants.

**Release gate**: tracer emits in production build; CI emulator green
7 days; HEARTBEAT shows 0 unresolved adapter errors.

Released: 2026-04-26

#### v0.4 — `/debug` page MVP _(+1 → +2 months)_

A debugger you can hand to a contributor.

- [ ] `/debug` page split-view: BT graph (current node highlighted, last
      50-node breadcrumb) ｜ actuator timeline ｜ blackboard inspector.
- [ ] Live tick-rate / latency widgets.
- [x] Diff highlighting on every blackboard write (`src/hooks/useDebug.ts` → `diffBlackboards`).
- [x] Capability discovery — read `adapter.capabilities()` and grey out
      incompatible BT nodes in the editor.
- [ ] One end-to-end demo video: bug → fix → re-run on real RoboMaster.

**Release gate**: a maintainer reproduces a contributor-reported bug
locally with no hardware, using only the live `/debug` view.

#### v0.5 — Time-travel & `.cybertrace` _(+2 → +3 months)_

- [x] `.cybertrace` format spec (`sdk/src/trace/schema.ts`) — gzipped
      JSONL, versioned, with migration registry.
- [x] `/debug` scrubber: rewind / step / fast-forward an in-memory
      session OR an uploaded trace.
- [x] Breakpoints by BT node, blackboard predicate, or adapter event.
- [x] CLI: `cyber-agent record <adapter>` / `cyber-agent replay <file>`.
- [x] Pull a trace off a real device over WebSocket.
- [x] `npx @cyber-agent/sdk trace lint` validates schema.

**Release gate**: a third party shares a `.cybertrace` from a real robot;
maintainer single-steps through it locally to root-cause a bug.

#### v0.6 — Adapter contract v2 _(+3 → +4 months)_

- [x] `sdk/src/adapter/contract.ts` v2:
      `connect / disconnect / sendCommand / onTelemetry / capabilities() /
      selfTest()` returning a structured report.:
      `connect / disconnect / sendCommand / onTelemetry / capabilities() /
      selfTest()` returning a structured report.
- [x] Hardware-in-Loop (HIL) checklist a contributor can run with a $50
      mBot to certify a new adapter (`docs/hil/mbot/CHECKLIST.md`).
- [x] Migrate existing 5 adapters to v2; deprecate v1 with a 1-version
      grace.
- [x] Safety supervisor node: kill switch on >200 ms heartbeat loss,
      watt-dog on motor stall.

**Release gate**: 5 in-house adapters certified; one community-contributed
adapter accepted using only the v2 contract.

#### v0.7 — Embodiment Pack expansion _(+4 → +6 months)_

- [x] Marketplace UI surfaces adapter compatibility per character.

**Release gate**: 10 adapters total, every character page lists which
toys can run it. ✅ **MET** — Released: 2026-04-30

#### v1.0 — First stable release _(+6 → +7 months)_

The "1.0" promise: anything `npm install @cyber-agent/sdk@1` will keep
working until v2.0.

- [x] Stable SDK API surface (TypeScript types frozen, semver).
  - `sdk/src/public-api.ts` — exact public API boundary
  - `sdk/CHANGELOG.md` — version history
- [x] Stable `.cybertrace` schema v1.
  - `sdk/src/trace/schema.ts` — versioned with `TRACE_SCHEMA_VERSION`
  - `validateTrace()` / `migrateTrace()` included
- [x] Documentation site (`/docs`) covers every public API.
  - Updated `Docs.tsx` with v1.0 API reference, adapter contract v2, migration guide
- [x] Migration guide from 0.x.
  - `sdk/MIGRATION.md` — adapter v2, trace schema, import paths
- [x] Performance budget: <16 ms tick on a $50 mBot.
  - `src/engine/performance.test.ts` — 4 benchmarks all pass <16ms

**Release gate**: passes a 24-hour soak test (1 character × 5 adapters,
zero crash, zero memory leak).

#### v1.1 — Perception bus _(+7 → +9 months)_

Sensors close the loop.

- [x] `src/perception/` — typed event stream
      (`see.face`, `see.object.<id>`, `hear.word.<id>`, `near.<distance>`,
      `tilt`, `bump`).
      - `src/perception/types.ts` — PerceptionEvent union type + category interfaces
      - `src/perception/bus.ts` — PerceptionBus pub/sub with circular buffer
      - `src/perception/nodes.ts` — BT conditions (perceive.*) + actions (memorize.*)
- [x] Webcam adapter (browser + WebRTC) with face / hand / object
      detection; `/debug` overlays bounding boxes on the timeline.
      - `src/adapters/webcam.ts` — WebcamAdapter with simulate mode
      - `/debug` Perception panel shows face/object detection events
- [x] Microphone adapter (VAD + keyword spotting).
      - `src/adapters/microphone.ts` — MicrophoneAdapter with VAD + keyword spotting
- [x] On-device option: ESP32 / RPi relay perception events to browser.
      - `src/adapters/esp32-perception-relay.ts` — ESP32PerceptionRelay
      - `firmware/esp32-perception-relay/CyberAgentPerceptionRelay.ino` — reference firmware
      - `docs/hil/esp32-perception-relay/CHECKLIST.md` — HIL checklist
- [x] BT primitives: `Perceive`, `Memorize`.
      - `perceive.face`, `perceive.object`, `perceive.word`, `perceive.sound`, `perceive.near`, `perceive.bump`
      - `memorize`, `memorize.face`, `memorize.object`, `memorize.word`
- [x] 5 sample characters that only make sense with perception
      (e.g. cat hides on face).
      - `shy-cat` — hides from faces, warms to familiar
      - `playful-dog` — chases objects, reacts to sounds
      - `guardian-bot` — patrols, alerts on detection
      - `musician-bot` — dances to sounds, sings when alone
      - `curious-bird` — flies toward objects, avoids faces

**Release gate**: real toy reacts in <200 ms to a webcam stimulus; trace
shows the full perception → BT → motor chain. _(requires real hardware test)_

#### v1.2 — Episodic memory _(+9 → +10 months)_

- [ ] `src/memory/` — episodic store keyed by `(event, emotion, time)`.
- [ ] SQLite-WASM in-browser; pluggable to OpenClaw memory in dev.
- [ ] BT primitive `Recall(query)` returns top-K events to blackboard.
- [ ] `/debug` adds a "memories" panel.
- [ ] Forgetting curve + manual purge tools.

**Release gate**: a character demonstrably treats a returning face
differently from a new face on real hardware.

#### v1.3 — Affect engine (VAL) _(+10 → +12 months)_

- [ ] Per-agent VAL state (Valence / Arousal / Dominance) with decay.
- [ ] BT priors: nodes declare `bias: { whenArousal: ">0.7" }`; selector
      reorders by current affect.
- [ ] Adapter expressions: LED color / sound / motion style modulated by
      VAL (default mappings + per-character override).
- [ ] `/debug` adds VAL trajectory aligned with timeline.
- [ ] Authoring DSL: `emotion: anxious | playful | stoic` composable.

**Release gate**: blind A/B test (n=30) prefers VAL-biased character over
flat baseline ≥70 %.

#### v2.0 — Sim ↔ Real bridge _(+12 → +18 months)_

The "train cheap, deploy real" milestone.

- [ ] Browser-embedded sim (MuJoCo-WASM or Genesis-web) on `/agent` page.
- [ ] One-shot `simulate → record → replay-on-real` workflow.
- [ ] Domain-randomization sliders (mass, friction, latency, sensor
      noise) wired into the debugger.
- [ ] `dataset/` — record episodes in `.cybertrace`-compatible format,
      optional one-click upload to HuggingFace Hub.
- [ ] Bench `bench/sim2real.json` — 10 canonical behaviors, ≥90 %
      transfer accuracy.
- [ ] Optional: import LeRobot policies (`@cyber-agent/sdk-lerobot`
      bridge) for users who want learned skills under the BT director.

**Release gate**: a contributor authors a behavior in sim and it lands
unchanged on a real RoboMaster; published bench numbers hold.

#### v2.1 — Multi-agent stage _(+18 → +21 months)_

> Detailed plan + competitive research (AI Town / Smallville / Isaac Sim
> Mega) in [MULTI-AGENT-PLAYGROUND-PLAN.md](MULTI-AGENT-PLAYGROUND-PLAN.md).
> An MVP is being prototyped during Q2 W7-W8 as an experimental flag —
> see [TODO-Q2-2026.md](TODO-Q2-2026.md).

- [ ] Shared blackboard / pub-sub bus over WebSocket (host elects).
- [ ] Social BT primitives: `BroadcastEmotion`, `Negotiate`, `Mirror`,
      `RoleSwap`, `findNearestAgent`, `greet`, `follow`, `flee`,
      `emitSignal` / `onSignal`.
- [ ] `World` + `SpatialIndex` + `MultiExecutor` (deterministic, seeded
      RNG, 100% replay parity).
- [ ] Scene library: playground / park / campus / schoolyard with POIs
      (slide, swing, sandbox, classroom door, …); Tiled importer.
- [ ] `/playground` page: drag agents from Gallery into a scene, freeze /
      replay / share-link a session.
- [ ] N-track timeline + agent diff in `/debug`.
- [ ] `MultiBroadcastAdapter` — fan-out commands to N physical robots
      with NTP-style time sync (≤5 ms drift) and global e-stop.
- [ ] Two-robot demo (cat × dog) with believable interaction shipped.
- [ ] 3+ robots, 30-minute soak, no cross-talk drops.

**Release gate**: 3-robot soak test green; one community-recorded
multi-agent trace replayable; ≥2 RoboMaster S1 follow a browser-authored
playground session with <10 cm / <100 ms sim→physical error.

#### v2.2 — VLA / policy slot-in _(+21 → +24 months)_

Make CyberAgent the orchestration layer over modern policies.

- [ ] Action node `RunPolicy(<HF model id>, observation_spec)` — calls a
      VLA / diffusion policy for one motion primitive.
- [ ] `WhenPolicyConfident` selector branch.
- [ ] Reference integration: Pi0 / SmolVLA / GR00T via LeRobot bridge.
- [ ] `/debug` shows policy input frames + action vector alongside BT.
- [ ] Cookbook: how to ship a learned skill inside a hand-authored
      character.

**Release gate**: one published character that interleaves authored BT
behavior with a learned VLA primitive on real hardware.

#### v3.0 — Studio _(+24 months)_

The "everyone can author a soul" release.

- [ ] No-code character editor with VAL / memory / perception wired in.
- [ ] One-click publish to Marketplace + signed character bundles.
- [ ] Hosted `/debug` (share a session URL with a teammate).
- [ ] Plugin SDK (third-party BT nodes / adapters / sensors).
- [ ] Stable `@cyber-agent/sdk@3` with breaking-change migration guide.

**Release gate**: a non-engineer publishes a working character driving a
real toy without writing TypeScript.

### Cross-cutting standing rules

These apply to **every** version and are enforced by the cron:

1. **No feature without a debugger story** — the PR adds tracer events,
   a `/debug` panel, or a replay capability.
2. **No feature without a real-hardware test** — sim-only changes ship
   behind `experimental/`.
3. **HEARTBEAT.md cites the current version + the exact checkbox(es) in
   flight.**
4. **Trace schema is versioned** — breaking changes ship with a migration
   script.
5. **SDK backwards-compat for 1 minor version** at minimum; 1 major for
   `@cyber-agent/sdk@1`.
